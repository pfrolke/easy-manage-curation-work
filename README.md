2. A new directory called easy-manage-curation-work-<version> will be created
3. Add the command script to your `PATH` environment variable by creating a symbolic link to it from a directory that is
   on the path, e.g. 
   
        ln -s /usr/local/easy-manage-curation-work-<version>/bin/easy-manage-curation-work /usr/bin



General configuration settings can be set in `cfg/application.properties` and logging can be configured
